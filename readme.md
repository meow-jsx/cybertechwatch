A Monitoring tool for Cyber Threats. (Collect Cyber News from different RSS Feeds).

at my job, I needed to check cyber threat news daily from multiple news sources; So I developed this python tool to ease my routine.

## Getting Started
this tool reads multiple cybernews feeds and organizes them into a <i>docx</i> file.


### Prerequisites

- Python
- python pip


### Installing

in ```windows``` run the following in <i>command prompt</i> or just double-click on  ``` setup.bat ``` then ```run.bat```

```
setup.bat

run.bat
```

for ```linux``` environments:

```
sh ./setup.sh

```
then wait for the result to be saved in <b>reports</b> directory.

from now on just ``` ./run.sh ``` to get the news.
